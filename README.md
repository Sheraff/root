# ðŸŒ³ Root
A fullstack typescript offline-first PWA template repo, ready to use
> [!TIP]
> **Quick start**: 
> Just click the <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button to create a new repository with this template.

## Client Package

A typescript React application, with

- Vitest
- Vite
- SQLite (vlcn.io CRDTs) + useQuery hook for reactive queries
- Tanstack Query + useQuery hook for server<->client type-safety

## Server Package

A typescript Fastify server, with

- SQLite (vlcn.io CRDTs)
- esbuild
- Vitest
- oauth through 3rd party providers

## Service Worker Package

A typescript service worker, with

- esbuild
- Hot Module Reloading

## Root Level

A workspace, with

- pnpm (package manager / script runner)
- eslint w/ type-aware linting (code quality)
- prettier (code formatting)
- knip (dead code elimination)
- turbo (monorepo manager / script cache)
- valibot (data validation)
- ts-reset (better typescript defaults)
- cspell (code spell-checking)
- github actions (CI/CD) with auto-releases
- a `script` folder for build-time shared code (node only, for CI, vite plugins, ...)
- a `shared` folder for run-time shared code (all environments, for client, server, service worker, ...)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies with pnpm:

```shell
pnpm install
```

To start the development server, run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

In dev mode, all requests go through Vite's dev server, and all `/api` requests are forwarded to the Fastify server.

To test the project, run:

```shell
pnpm test
```

To serve the production build, run:

```shell
pnpm serve
```

In production mode, all requests go through the Fastify server.

To build the project for production, run:

```shell
pnpm build
```

The assets necessary for running the project after it has been built are:
- `/dist`
- `.env`
- `/node_modules` (because not all imports are bundled)
- `/db` (though it will be generated if it doesn't exist)

> [!TIP]
> **Easy depolyment**: 
> The `bundle.tar.xz` release artifact uploaded to GitHub contains
> - the `/dist` folder,
> - the `package.json` file,
> - and the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.
> 
> After unpacking,
> 1. provide your `.env` file,
> 2. install the runtime dependencies (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod`)
>
> And the app is ready to run.
> This allows you to use the GitHub webhooks to call your server and easily re-deploy on every version change.

- [ ] database: figure out migrations story, maybe through drizzle?
- [ ] cleanup bento: make the default page nicer looking
- [ ] docs: look into [mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) or [fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/) to provide better documentation than this readme
